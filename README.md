# JsonListApp

## About the application
This is the application where i am using randomly generated JSON data to present list of users. 
Every user has its own index, name, email, about section and picture.
There is listview where all of users are listed and it is infinite, that means that i can get more users and everything will stay the same.
Also every user in a listview is clickable and then it is redirected to the "About me" page.

There are screenshots of both screens:
